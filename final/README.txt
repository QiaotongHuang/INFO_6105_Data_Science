INFO 6105 Assignment Final
Author: Qiaotong Huang(002728446) && Gulinigeer_Aihemaiti(002766465)

In the final assignment, we continued our work on the midterm music classification dataset and optimized it based on midterm feedback. Many different algorithms have been re-examined, including: decision trees, kNN, Boosting, SVM, and neural networks and CNNs. Different regularization methods, neuron types and number of hidden layers were compared in neural networks.
